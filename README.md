# Tesla and GameStop Stock Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python project that focuses on extracting and visualizing stock data, specifically for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) stocks. Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science, as it empowers individuals to make informed decisions based on the data. In this assignment, we will extract stock data and revenue data for Tesla and GameStop, respectively, and display this data in graphical format.
